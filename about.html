Although man is inevitably a part of its outworking, it is God himself who initiates and makes known His purposes to individuals. This is the only possible explanation for the beginning of Anusaran. Our desire is to make Evangelical Literature available to the nation, so that people may come to faith and maturity in the Lord Jesus Christ. We are trying to reach the masses through our online library.

                            <p class="tm-margin-b-p">As you go through our website, we assure you our best services. We are here to help you to get all the Christian literature in different languages and versions, the purpose of sharing God's love with the people of the world.
